# Guess My Number

The Guess MyN umber game is based on choosing a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive), which the player has to guess. For each wrong guess a point is deducted from 20 (the default). The game saves the highest score.

The game was created in the JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
